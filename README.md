### ABOUT

This is just a simple tool to generate a **Markdown** file as a To-Do list using the console.
Recommended to put this exe in an empty folder as this will create the md file in the same folder where the exe is.
***

### HOW TO USE IT

Just run the .exe and it will initialize then it will ask you to type something, The typings of yours will be marked as **"[USER] "**.

When you are done adding tasks, type **done@** to finish adding tasks. Then read the text given by Console.

You will need a markdown reader to see the check box and the markdown Todo list.
